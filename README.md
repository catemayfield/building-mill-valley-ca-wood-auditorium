# Wood Auditorium
700 Miller, Mill Valley, CA 94941 (now referred to as "Gus' Gym")

## Building History
When Tam High was opened in 1908, only 64 students attended, and they were taught in tents by a grand total of three teachers. Wood Auditorium was built by students in 1922 due to expanding need for athletic facilities.*  E.E. Wood, founder and first principal of Tam High, saw the unique opportunity to provide meaningful training in mechanical drawing, carpentry, cabinet making and painting for the students. 
The gym/auditorium was re-named for George Gustafason after his retirement in 1971.  Gustafson had coached football, swimming, and tennis for 37 years at Tam High. In 1972 scenes from the film "American Graffiti" were filmed in the gym. During the 1990s and 2000s the gym underwent many renovations. The four towers were removed as well several of the large side windows. 
*Wood Auditorium should not be confused with Wood Hall, Tam High’s original classroom and cafeteria building, which currently houses the school’s administrative offices. Wood Hall was also named for E.E. Wood, but was built circa 1908 and dedicated to Mr. Wood at his retirement in the 1940s.
